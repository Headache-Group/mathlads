  - title: "Calculus"
    id: "calculus"
    image: "/images/service-3.png"
    content: "While algebra studies about generalization of arithmetic opeartions, calculus reveals the knowledge about continuos changes. Today, calculus has widespread application in science and engineering, from theoretical to application fields. This series will be based on two courses of Calculus of our school and more deeper knowledge on proving theorem if possible."

    content: "Statistics is a mathematical body of science that relates to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. In this series, we will talk many topics including mainly about probability theory, distributions of data, and statistical hypothesis test."

    content: "Many real-world problems can be modeled mathematically into equations. Finding their exact roots value is almost impossible (in fact, proving those equations exists solution alone has been a tough task already). In real life however, approximation of those values is enough to apply in engineering and many other aspects. The background of those approximation techniques is the content of numerical analysis. In this series, we will discover exactly the theory of those knowledge."
