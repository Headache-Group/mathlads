We are a group of 7 HCMUT (Ho Chi Minh University of Technology) students aspiring to build a stable mathematical foundation for applied sciences, especially AI and Machine Learning. Therefore, our posts will mostly be fundamental, covering Linear algebraic, Calculus, Numerical Anlytical topics.

We aim to provide a digestible, fun and in-depth demonstration of the most basic knowledge.
